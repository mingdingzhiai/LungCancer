# Data Science Bowl

This project is directly linked to the [Data Science Bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2017), which I was keen on participating to it. However, my skills did not integrate 3D vision at this time, and I simply enjoyed visualisation from 2D to 3D. Since I read a lot, this mainly aims at performing better and faster than the other kernels, in a way that seemed more efficient and robust to me.

## Method

The method is the following : extraction of main zones along the z axis of the CT scans ; removal of the outliers according to their distribution ; 3D reconstruction.
